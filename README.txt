Dataset 1.1: Truck Arrivals and Departure Information for May 2020


Data Source: Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 Bulletins Issues 29,30,31, 34,35,36,37,39, and 40, available on the publicly accessible Google Drive Folder https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/18Jjt0xLiCV9WXBrqnEkGIQkWC_KvW5ds


Dataset Compilation: Since the Bulletins are provided as image-only PDF files, we manually input the arrivals and departures data into the CSV file. 


Data Description: The first row contains the column labels. The first column contains a date range for which the arrivals and departures information is provided. The data is sparsely reported and is reported from the 8th until the 26th of May, despite the borders operating daily. Columns 2 - 21 represents the arrivals and departures information for each of the 10 borders, for which data and truck traffic is assumed to pass through. The last 3 columns compute different totals from the data.

Data Source: Same as Dataset 1.1


Dataset Compilation: Same as Dataset 1.1
