This GitHub repository is meant to accompany our research project on Mitigating Potential Propagation 
of Covid-19 by Long-Distance Truck Drivers in Botswana. It contains data tables used in estimating 
various parameters in our model, as described in the project write-up. It also has the Python code 
for the regression used to predict the value of statistical life for Botswana from VSL Estimates 
by Viscusi for selected countries and their GDP per capita. The other Python code is the model 
simulation.

The sources of the data used in our simulation are outlined in the project write up.
